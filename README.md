Welcome to the portfolio project in CS 101: Introduction to Programming!

In this portfolio project, you will research, brainstorm, and build a basic terminal program of your choice for your friends and family to play with. After you finish building the program, you will create a blog post to share the program on a publication of your choice!


I set up the project following a basic file/folder structure that copilot suggested. If something is unnecessary or empty then that is the reason.

Also, I will be using copilot in the project as a tool to help develop as quickly as possible. So, if some code looks like AI wrote it, then it probably did :D lol.
